<h2><strong>Project Description/Summary</strong></h2>
This project is very similar to the <a href="https://jsbeginners.com/testimonials-project">Testimonials JavaScript Project.</a> I did find it a lot easier, however. For this image slider, when an arrow is clicked, the next image in the array shows up.

<h2><strong>New Things Learned or Refreshed</strong></h2>
Before doing this project, I didn't realize how easy it was to make a slider project. I thought it was just a jQuery thing. Turns out I was wrong.

<h2><strong>Biggest Take Away(s)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Image sliders aren't a jQuery thing. All I had to do was access different images from inside of an array. And to make accessing each image easier, I just needed to make sure images had the same name but different numbers so they can be accessed by an index.
